## 🌟 Introduction

As coding agents evolve from simple completion tools to autonomous software engineers, the bottleneck has shifted. To achieve general intelligence for software engineering, we need **dynamic, scalable, and high-fidelity environments** that enable continuous learning.

This repository is a curated collection of resources dedicated to:
1. **Automated Environment Setup**: Converting raw GitHub Issues/PRs into reproducible, sandboxed execution environments.
2. **Scalable Instance Synthesis**: Generating infinite, diverse training instances beyond existing human-annotated data.
3. **Novel Training Paradigms**: Scaling autonomous training loops through self-play and recursive feedback.


### Core Pillars

| Pillar | Description | Keywords |
|---|---|---|
| **Auto-Grounding** | Automatically resolving dependencies and environment state from project metadata. | `Repo-to-Env`, `Dependency Resolution` |
| **Instance Synthesis** | Scaling the problem space beyond human-written issues. | `Issue Synthesis`, `Unit Test Generation` |
| **Training Paradigms** | Beyond standard RL: Scaling via self-play, search-based optimization, and recursive self-improvement. | `Self-Play `, `MCTS`, `PRM`, `Autonomous Scaling` |
